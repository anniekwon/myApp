- What is String concatenation?
- Why are Strings immutable?
- What is the difference between '==' and '.equals()' when comparing two strings?
- What does the substring() method do?


## Debugging Fundamentals

- What is debugging?

  *Systematic process of spotting and fixing the number of bugs, or defects, in a piece of software so that the software is behaving as expected. Debugging is harder for complex systems in particular when various subsystems are tightly coupled as changes in one system or interface may cause bugs to emerge in another.*
  
- What is an Exception in Java?

  *Unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program at run time, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. Execptions can be caught and handled by the program, when an exception occurs within a method, it creates and obuject. This object is called the exception object. It contains information about the exception such as the name and description of the exception and the state of the program when the exception occured.*
  
- What is a Stack Trace in Java?

  *Stack Trace is location of the exceptions and an array of stack frames. Stack frames represent the movement of an application during the execution of the program. It traces the locations where exception raised.*
  
- What is Exception Handling and why do we do it?

  *An effective mean to handle the runtime errors so that the regular flow of the application can be preserved. It is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException, IOException, SQLException, RemoteException, etc. It is to recognize what type of errors that occur. Like invalid user input, device failure, loss of network connection, physical limitations, code errors, opening an unavailable file.*
  
- What is the syntax to set up a try/catch block in Java?

  *try { block of code to try } catch (Exception e) {block of code to handle errors}*
  
- Can I have more than one catch block?

  *Yes, you can have multiple catch for a single try block.*
  
- Can I have more than one Exception caught by the same catch block?

  *Yes, you can use vertical bars to separate multiple exceptions in catch block.*
  
- What is a Finally block in java?

  *The finally block in java is used to put important codes such as clean up code like closing the file or closing the connection. The finally block executes whether exception rise or not and whether exception handled or not. A finally contains all the crucial statements regardless of the exception occurs or not.*
  
- Do I need to have a catch block or can I just have a try/finally block?

  *Yes, it is possible to have a try block without a catch block by using a final block. A final block will always execute even there is an exception occured in a try block.*
  
- What is Breadcrumming?

  *A trail of events that happened prior to an issue.*

## Logging Fundamentals

- What is logging and why is it valuable?

  *The ability to capture the log files. It records unusual circumstances of errors that may be happening in the program and gets the info about what's going in the application.*
  
- What is a good way to keep logs available long term?

  *Save logs to a text file. Like Log4J, appender - using slf4j method which comes from Java Log Utility.*
  
- What is File I/O in Java?

  *Java I/O stream is the flow of data that you can either read from, or you can write to. It is used to perform read and write operations in file permanently. Java uses streams to perform these tasks. Java I/O stream is also called File Handling, or File I/O. It is available in java.io package.*
