### SQL

1.  Explain what SQL is.

*SQL stands for Structural Query Language*

3.  Draw a simple ERD for modeling Students and Classes
4.  What are the 5 sublanguages of SQL? Which commands correspond to them?

*DQL - Data Query Language, DDL - Data Definition Language, DML - Data Manipulation Language, DCL - Data Control Language, TCL - Transaction Control Language*

5.  What is the difference between DELETE, DROP, and TRUNCATE commands?

*DELETE is to remove rows within the table in which each row is scanned, DROP is removing a table, and TRUNCATE is to remove all rows without scanning each row.*

7.  What are some SQL clauses you can use with SELECT statements?
8.  What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING?
9.  Explain what the ORDER BY and GROUP BY clauses do.

*ORDER BY is listing each row of the data in order of alphabetical and numerical value and GROUP BY is grouped by similar values of a key that is called*. 

- Practice [here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_orderby.asp).
11.  Explain the concept of relational integrity.

*The concept is rule that enforces basic and fundamental information-based contraints lke not null, references. Relational integrity constraint is used to ensure accuracy and consistency of data in a relational database.*

13. List the integrity constraints.

*Check constraints, not null contraints, unique constraints, primary keys, foreign keys and exclusions*

15. Define the word “schema”.
16. What is a candidate key? What about a surrogate key?
17. What conditions lead to orphan records? (_Think about what happens when we delete from a table that a child table is dependent on because it feautres its Primary keys as foreign keys within the table_)
18. What are some SQL data types?
19. What is normalization? What are the levels? (0 - 3NF)
20. What are the properties a transaction must follow? (_A.C.I.D_)
21. Explain the different isolation levels. What read phenomena do each prevent?
22. What is the difference between joins and set operators?
23. What are the types of joins? Explain the differences.
24. What is a cascade delete?
25. How would you setup a primary key that automatically increments with every INSERT statement?
26. What is the difference between scalar and aggregate functions? Give examples of each

### JDBC
1. What is JDBC?
2. What are the core interfaces / classes in JDBC?
3. What is a stored procedure and how would you call it in Java?
4. What is the difference between Statement and PreparedStatement?
5. Steps to executing an SQL query using JDBC?
6. How to execute stored procedures using JDBC?
7. Which interface is responsible for transaction management?
   > `Connection` Interface. See this resource here about [JDBC and Transaction management](https://www.javatpoint.com/transaction-management-in-jdbc#:~:text=In%20JDBC%2C%20Connection%20interface%20provides%20methods%20to%20manage%20transaction)
### Docker

* What is a container? How is it different from a VM?
* What is a Docker image? Container?
* How is a Docker image different from a Docker container?
* List the steps to start Docker, create a Docker image, and spin up a container
* What is the relevance of the Dockerfile to this process? List some keywords in the Dockerfile.
* What are some other Docker commands?
