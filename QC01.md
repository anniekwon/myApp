# Week 1 QC Questions

## Computer / OS Fundamentals

- What is the difference between a Client and a Server?
  
  *Client is a local machine that users use like a program or an application that makes requests from a server. Server is a computer that processes requests.*

- What is an Operating System?

  *It is a software platform that controls hardware to run a program.*

- What are some common Client operating systems?

  *Windows, MacOS, Linux*

- What are some common Server operating systems?

  *Window Server, Mac Server*

- What does it mean to be Open Source?

  *A code base that is not licensed and free to all to download and manipulate.*

- Why would a server want to run an open source operating system?

  *Open source is broader and cheaper. The security is improved, coding is easier to process because many people contributed, more stable.*

## Fundamentals of Version Control

- What is Version Control and why is it valuable?

  *A system that tracks of changes in coding over time. It's valuable because developers are able to go back to previous versions if they make mistakes.*
  
- What is Git?

  *It is a version control system that provides it remotely.*
  
- What is a Git Hosting Provider and what are some examples?

  *It is a remote platform that provies Git. Examples are GitHub, Amazon AWS, GitLab*
  
- What are some common Git Commands?

  *Git push, git pull, git commit -m, git status, git log*
  
- What are the steps to create a new repository and make an initial commit?

  *mkdir foldername -> add new repository on github -> credentials established -> copy github url -> git remote add orgin url -> git push -u origin main-> git init -> git add -> git commit -> git push.*
  
- What are the steps to push to a remote repository?

  *git add -> git commit -> git push.*

## Programming Fundamentals

- What is Programming?

  *A sequential coding instruction for computer to execute.*
  
- What is Control Flow?

  *Different types of statements that affect the flow of the program.*
  
- What are some common Control Flow Statements in Java?

  *While, for, do while, if else*
  
- What is the entry point for any Java application and what is the syntax for writing it?

  *Public static void main(String[] args)*
  
- What is an Annotation?

  *It is a tag for metadat to give additional information attahed to class, interface, methods or fields.*
  
- What is a Method in java?

  *A method is a block of code or collection of statements or a set of code grouped together to perform a certain task or operations.*
  
- What is a Method Parameter?

  *It acts as variable insde the method so the information can be passed to methods.*
  
- What is a Constructor?

  *A special method to initialized objects.*

## Testing Fundamentals

- What is a Unit Test and why is it valuable?

  *A testing technique using which individual modules are tested to determine if there are any issues by the developer. It is concerned with functional correctness of the standalone modules. The main aim is to isolate each unit of the system to identify, analyze, and fix the defects. It is also automated.*
  
- What is TDD?

  *Test driven development. Write a 'single' unit test describing an aspect of the program. Run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature. Write just enough code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass. "Refractor" the code, until it conforms to the simplicity criteria. Repeat, "accumulating" unit tests over time.*
  
- What is an assertion?

  *An assertion allows testing the corectness of any assumptions that have made in the program. An assertion is achieved using the assert statement in Java. While executing assertion, it is believed to be true. If it fails, JVM throws an error named Assertion Error. It is mainly used for testing purposes during development.*
  
- What are the steps for the Red/Green testing process?

  *Fail -> Red -> think about what you want to develop. Pass -> Green -> think about how to make your tests pass. Refractor -> think about how to improve your exisiting implementation.*
  
- What is JUnit?

  *A unit testing framework for Java programming language. JUnit has been important in the development of test-driven development, and is one of a family of unit testing framkework collectively known as XUnit, that originated with JUnit.*
  
- What are some common JUnit Annotations?

  *@Test, @Overdrive*
