## Java Basics
* What is Java? / Why Java?

*Java is an high level OOP language that is secured and statically variable typed. It also features an automatic garbage collection. The reason we use Java because so many applications use Java. It's reliable and it's secure.*

* What is JRE / JDK / JVM?

*JRE is Java Runtime Environment that runs the java applications and contains a bunch of helpful libraries to assists the JVM. JDK is Java Development Kit contains a compliler, and a bunch of Java SE APIs. JVM is Java Virtual Machine is an isolated virtual machine.*

* What is an object / class?

*Object is instantiated and is unique, contains behaviors from the class. Class is an user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. Object class is when every class in Java is directly or indirectly derived from the Object class. If a class does not extend any other class then it is a direct child class of Object and if it extends, object class acts as a root of inheritance hierchy in any Java program.*

* What is the root class from which every class extends?

*Object Class*

* What are the primitive data types in Java?

*boolean, int, float, double, char, byte, long, short*

* Where are Strings stored?

*Strings are stored in a heap because it is an object.*

* Explain stack vs heap?

*They're memory allocations which stack is linear that stores primitive types, methods, and references to objects and heap is flexible that stores objects and string pools.*

* What are annotations?

*
* What is a POJO? What is a bean?
* How can you force garbage collection in Java?
* Why are strings immutable in java?
* What is the difference between `String`, `StringBuilder`, and `StringBuffer`?
* What are the access modifiers in Java? Explain them.
* What are the non-access modifiers in Java?
* What is the difference between `static` and `final` variables?
* What are the default values for all data types in Java?
* What is a wrapper class?
* What is autoboxing / unboxing?
* Is Java pass-by-value or pass-by-reference?
* If two objects are equal, do they have the same hashcode? If not equal?
* What data types are supported in switch statements?
* List all non-access modifiers?
* How to pass multiple values with a single parameter into a method?
* Can we access static/non-static variables from static/non-static methods (see example)?
```java
public class A {
  public static int x = 1;
  public int y = 2;
  public static void doStuff() {
    System.out.println(y);
  }
  public void doMoreStuff() {
    System.out.println(x);
  }
}
```
* What is static block?
* What is static imports?
* What methods are available in the Object class?
* What is the difference between `==` and `.equals()`?
* What is an enhanced for loop and what is a `forEach` loop?
* What are 3 usages of `super` keyword?
  
## OOP
* What are the 4 pillars of OOP / Explain each?
* Is this allowed? Is this an example of method overloading or overriding?
```java
public abstract class Super {
  public abstract Collection getCollection();
}
public abstract class Sub extends Super {
  public abstract List getCollection();
}
```
* What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?
* What are the implicit modifiers for interface variables?
* What is the difference between method overloading and overriding?
* Can you overload / override a main method? static method? a private method? a default method? a protected method?
*  Explain the difference
```java
List<String> mylist = new ArrayList<>();
ArrayList<String> list2 = new ArrayList<>();
```
* Difference between extends and implements?
* What are enumerations (enums)?
* What are the implicit modifiers for interface variables / methods?
* First line of constructor?
* Can you instantiate this class? Why or why not?
```java
public class Hello {}
```
## Exceptions
* What is the difference between `final`, `.finalize()`, and `finally`?
* `throw` vs `throws` vs `Throwable`?
* What is try-with-resources? What interface must the resource implement to use this feature?
* Do you need a catch block? Can have more than 1? Order of them?
* What is base class of all exceptions? What interface do they all implement?
* List some checked and unchecked exceptions?
* Multi-catch block - can you catch more than one exception in a single catch block?
* Is this an example of a checked or unchecked exception?
```java
public class MyException extends RuntimeException {}
```
